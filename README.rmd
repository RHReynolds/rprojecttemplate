# Background

This `R` package was made for personal use, and aims to create an R project directory primed for data analysis. It has a simple focus on:

1. Creating a standardised project folder structure with a few template files needed for beginning a data analysis project
2. Use of practices that make it easier for the project to be reproducible and open

The structure makes use of the existing and established packages ([`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/), [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/), and [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)) and is intended for use with RStudio.

# Installation

To access the template on RStudio first install `rprojecttemplate` with:

``` {.r}
remotes::install_github("RHReynolds/rprojecttemplate")
```

# Usage

## Getting started

There are two ways of creating a new project: using the R console or using the RStudio "New Project" menu option.

Through the console, use the `setup_project()` command.  For example:

``` {.r}
library(rprojecttemplate)
rprojecttemplate::setup_project("~/Desktop/test-analysis")
```

This then creates a directory tree, with template files for starting your analysis. Open the newly created project via the `.Rproj` file. 

For the RStudio approach, go to "File -> New Project", then "New directory" and find the `rprojecttemplate` project in the list (it should be listed as "Data analysis project using rprojecttemplate"). 

For a more detailed tutorial see the [introduction vignette](https://rhreynolds.github.io/rprojecttemplate/articles/rprojecttemplate.html).
