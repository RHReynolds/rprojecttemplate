# rprojecttemplate 0.99.1

NEW FEATURES

* Added a project template for GitLab, which can be accessed by using argument `type` in `setup_project()`.
* `update_index()`: function that will generate an md-formatted table containing links to .htmls in a specified folder. This function can be used to generate the `index.html` page that will serve as the landing page for GitLab pages or GitHub pages. 

FIXES

* [#481ad7c](https://github.com/RHReynolds/rprojecttemplate/commit/481ad7c9829f6a06f9881ac26464ccdce5df25c0): fixed error with `update_index()` that occurred when `include_number = FALSE`

# rprojecttemplate 0.99.0

NEW FEATURES
