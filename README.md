This \[R\] package was made for personal use, and aims to create an R
project directory primed for data analysis. It has a simple focus on:

1.  Creating a standardized project folder structure with a few template
    files needed for beginning a data analysis project
2.  Use of practices that make it easier for the project to be
    reproducible and open

The structure makes use of the existing and established packages
(devtools, usethis, and renv) and is intended for use with RStudio.

# Installation

To access the template on RStudio first install `rprojecttemplate` with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("RHReynolds/rprojecttemplate")
```
