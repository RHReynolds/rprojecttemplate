# Description of `scripts/` folder

This folder contains analysis scripts. Each script should contain a one-line 
description and should be named such that it corresponds to an .Rmd in `docs/`. 
Consider using numbering and lettering to denote the sequence in which
scripts should be run.

Remember that well-written scripts should be:

- Clear in their intended purpose
- Explicit about requirements/dependencies
- Sequential
- Consistent in their style
