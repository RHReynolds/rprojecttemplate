# Description of `docs/` folder

This folder contains all `.Rmd`s and their corresponding `.html`s describing analyses performed for this project. Consider using numbering and lettering to denote the sequence in which `.Rmd`s were run. 

If you want to be able to view `docs/` interactively, you will need to set up [GitLab pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/). The necessary GitLab CI template required for hosting a simple html is already available in the project directory (see [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../.gitlab-ci.yml)). The landing page of the interactive page will be [../index.rmd](../index.rmd), so make sure this is up to date.
