Some TODO items after creating this project. Can delete this file after completing them.

- Fill in project details in:
    - [README.rmd](README.rmd) and remember to knit your README using `devtools::build_readme()`.
    - [index.rmd](index.rmd) and remember to knit with `devtools::build_rmd("index.rmd")`
- Read through the README files in each directory and edit as necessary.
- Add and commit all files under Git version control.
- Decide whether to set up [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) or use `DESCRIPTION` for reproducibility.
- Set up [GitLab pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).
- Edit [index.rmd](index.rmd) to reflect analyses run.
