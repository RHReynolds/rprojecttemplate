# Description of `docs/` folder

This folder contains all `.Rmd`s and their corresponding `.html`s describing analyses performed for this project. Consider using numbering and lettering to denote the sequence in which `.Rmd`s were run. 

This folder also contains a ["table of contents"](index.md), which provides an overview of the analyses run. Remember to modify this as you introduce new analyses.

If you want to be able to view `docs/` interactively, you will need to set up [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Remember to change the folder from which the Github Pages site is built to `docs/`. The landing page of the interactive page will be [index.md](index.md), so make sure this is up to date. **WORD OF WARNING:** even if your repository is *private*, the interactive site will be *public*, so think twice about whether you want to do this at the beginning or end of a project.
