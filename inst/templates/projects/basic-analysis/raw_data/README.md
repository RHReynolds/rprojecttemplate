# Description of `raw_data/` folder

This folder should either:

1. Contain the raw, unprocessed data used specifically for each analysis. 
2. In those situations where raw data files are too large to be loaded to github, consider:
    a. Uploading those files to a repository like zenodo or figshare (assuming they are do not contain patient-sensitive information).
    b. If the files are publicly available, include either a script with commands to download these files can be a text file describing where and how to download these files.
